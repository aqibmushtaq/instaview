The '''Earth''', our world, is the third [[planet]] from the [[Sun]]. It is one of the four [[terrestrial planet]]s in our [[Solar System]]. This means most of its [[mass]] is [[solid]]. The other three are [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars (planet)|Mars]].

The Earth is [[home]] to millions of species of plants and animals,<ref></ref> including [[humans]]. Earth is the only place in the [[universe]] where [[life]] has been confirmed to exist.<ref name=purves_et_al2001></ref> The Earth [[Age of the Earth|formed]] around 4.5 billion years ago.<ref name="age earth"></ref><ref></ref> The things that live on Earth have had a great impact on many aspects of the planet. For example, early lifeforms completely changed its air ([[atmosphere]]). The total of all life is called the [[biosphere]].<ref></ref>

About 71% of Earth's surface is covered in [[salt water]] [[ocean]]s. Earth is the only planet where [[liquid]] [[water]] is known to exist at present.<ref></ref>

The other 29% is made of rocky land in the shape of [[continent]]s and [[island]]s. Earth [[wikt:interact|interact]]s with other objects in the [[Solar System]], particularly the [[Sun]] and [[the Moon]]. The Earth orbits or circles the [[Sun]] roughly once every 365.25 days. One spin of the Earth is called a ''[[day]]'' and one orbit around the Sun is called a ''[[year]]''. This is why there are 365 days in a year. Earth has only one [[Satellite (natural)|moon]], known as [[the Moon]].

== History ==


The [[Age of the Earth|Earth]] and the other [[planet]]s formed about 4.6 billion years ago.<ref name="age_earth" /> They were made of the leftover [[gas]] from the [[nebula]] that [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|made the Sun]]. The Moon may have been formed after a collision between Earth and a smaller planet (sometimes called ''Theia''). Scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off — becoming (by [[gravity]]) the Moon.<ref></ref>

[[Condensation|Condensing]] [[water vapour]], [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s hitting the Earth made the [[ocean]]s. Within a billion years (that is at about 3.6 billion years ago) the first [[life]] [[evolution|evolved]], in the [[Archaean]] [[era]].<ref></ref> Some [[bacteria]] developed [[photosynthesis]], which lets plants make [[food]] from the [[Sun]]'s [[light]] and [[water]]. This released a lot of [[oxygen]], which was first taken up by [[iron]] in [[solution]]. Eventually, free oxygen got into the [[atmosphere]] or air, making the Earth's surface [[wikt:suitable|suitable]] for [[aerobic]] life (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]). This oxygen also formed the [[ozone]] [[wikt:layer|layer]] which protects the Earth from bad [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] from the [[Sun]]. This protection made it possible for things to move from the deep ocean to the surface.

Long ago almost all land was in one place. This is called a [[continent|supercontinent]]. The earliest known supercontinent was called ''Rodina''. Scientists think that soon after this there was a time (the [[Cryogenian]]) when the Earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets ([[glacier]]s).<ref name=snearth></ref> This is called the [[Snowball Earth]] [[theory]].<ref name=snearth />

== What it is made of ==
[[File:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|thumb|right|A rough size comparison of Earth and the other three terrestrial [[planet]]s, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]].]]

Earth is a [[Terrain|terrestrial]] planet. This means it is made up of solid [[rock (geology)|rock]] unlike a [[gas giant]] such as [[Jupiter]]. It is the largest out of the four terrestrial planets in [[mass]] and [[diameter]].

===Chemical composition===
The Earth is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. The core region is mainly composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.<ref> Morgan J.W. & Anders E. 1980. Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Science'' '''77''' (12): 6973–6977. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350422/?tool=pmcentrez] Full free text</ref>

A little more than 47% of the [[Earth's crust]] consists of oxygen. The more common rocks of the Earth's crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s. The main oxides are [[silica]], [[alumina]], [[iron oxide]]s, lime (calcium oxide), [[magnesia]], [[potash]] and [[soda]]. From an [[analysis]] of all kinds of rocks, 99.22% were composed of 11 oxides, with other constituents occurring in minute quantities.<ref>This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh (ed) 1911. "Petrology". In ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. Cambridge University Press.</ref>

=== Shape ===
The Earth's [[shape]] is an [[oblate]] [[spheroid]]. This means it is basically a [[sphere]] but it [[wikt:bulge|bulge]]s around the middle. The [[circumference]] of the Earth is about 40,000&nbsp;[[kilometer]]s; the average [[width]] of the Earth is about 12,700&nbsp;km.  The highest point on Earth is the peak of [[Mount Everest]] at 8,848 m above [[sea]] level. The lowest natural point is the bottom of the [[Mariana Trench]] at 10,911 meters below sea level. Because of the bulge at the middle or the [[equator]], the farthest point from the Earth's center is the top of [[Mount Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]].<ref name=ps20_5_16></ref><ref name=lancet365_9462_831></ref><ref name=tall_tales></ref>

[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of the inside of the Earth, showing the different layers.]]

=== Internal structure ===

Inside, the Earth is similar to the other terrestrial planets. It has an outer, solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]] layer called the [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Everything that lives on Earth is on top of the crust. Below that is a layer of thick, [[semi-liquid]] rock called the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Under that is a thin liquid layer called the outer [[planetary core|core]] and then the solid [[iron]] inner core.
The thickness of the crust changes. On land the average is between 30–50 kilometers thick. Under the [[ocean]]s in some places it is only 6 kilometers thick.<ref></ref> The inside of the Earth is very hot, the temperature of the outer core may be as high as .<ref></ref>

=== Tectonic plates ===

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|right|A [[map]] showing the Earth's major tectonic plates.]]

The Earth is the only terrestrial planet with active plate tectonics.<ref name=jour></ref>
Due to plate tectonics the Earth's crust basically floats on the thick liquid rock of the mantle below.<ref name="TecPlates" ></ref> The crust is split up into parts called plates. These plates interact as they move about causing [[earthquake]]s and creating [[volcano]]es and [[mountain]] ranges. The place where plates meet are called plate boundaries. There are three types of plate boundary: ''constructive'', ''destructive'' and ''transform''.<ref name=jour /><ref name=book1></ref><ref name=book2></ref>
* At a ''divergent plate boundary'' two plates move away from each other, and hot [[magma]] (liquid rock) is pushed upwards through the cracks. These kinds of boundaries make [[ocean]] rifts, undersea volcanoes or ridges. Example: [[Mid-ocean ridge]]s; [[Great Rift Valley]].<ref name = 'platetectonics.com'></ref><ref name = 'usgs.understanding.com'></ref>

* At a ''convergent'' (destructive) plate boundary, two plates move towards each other. This forms islands, [[volcano]]es and high [[mountain]] ranges. Examples: the [[Himalayas]]; the [[Andes]]; the [[Japanese]] island arc.<ref name=book1 />

* At a ''transform plate boundary'', two plates move parallel to each other. As they move the grind against each other. This kind of plate boundary causes [[earthquake]]s. Example:[[San Andreas Fault]].<ref name=book2 />

=== Surface ===
The Earth changes greatly from place to place. Over 70% of the Earth surface is covered by [[water]].<ref name="Physical-Hydro"></ref> The underwater surface has many of the same features as the above sea with [[volcano]]s, [[mountain]]s and trenches or [[canyon]]s. The 30% not covered by water is mostly [[forest]]s, [[desert]]s, [[plain]]s, [[mountain]]s and [[plateau]]x. [[Human]] [[civilisation]] has led to increasing urbanisation — the growth of [[city|cities]].

Many things can change the surface of the Earth. [[Plate tectonics]] is main cause of change but there are others such as [[erosion]] from [[wind]] and [[rain]], erosion by the [[ocean]]s or [[meteorite]] impacts. There are three main types of rock that make up the Earth's surface:

* [[Igneous rock]] is made when [[magma]] or [[lava]] from the mantle reaches the surface and cools. As it gets colder it turns into rock or solidifies.

* [[Sedimentary rock]] is made from sediment, like [[sand]] or small bits of other rock, that has been crushed and packed tightly together.

* [[Metamorphic rock]] which is made when either of the other two types are changed by high or low [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s.

=== Hydrosphere ===
All the [[water]] on Earth, on land or in the [[atmosphere]], is part of the hydrosphere. About 97.5% of all water is [[salt water]]. About half the fresh water is currently [[ice]].<ref></ref>
The oceans absorb or soak up [[carbon dioxide]], a [[gas]] that adds to the [[greenhouse effect]] and global warming.

=== Atmosphere ===
A planet's [[atmosphere]] is a layer of different [[gas]]es surrounding it. It is kept there by [[gravity]]. The Earth's atmosphere is made of about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]] and small amounts of other gases.<ref></ref> This mixture is often called air. Further up there is a layer of [[ozone]] gas called the Ozone layer. Ozone absorbs [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] from [[the Sun]]. Ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to [[people]], so without the Ozone layer [[life]] would not be possible. The atmosphere also protects the earth from crashes with [[meteor]]s and small [[asteroid]]s. This is because they burn up due to all the [[friction]] as they fly through it. It also helps to keep Earth warm. Some gases including [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]] act like a blanket around the Earth, they trap heat under them, keeping the Earth warm. This is called the natural [[greenhouse effect]].<ref></ref> When humans build factories and power plants to make electricity, [[combustion]] is involved. Combustion lets out a lot of carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide goes up into the atmosphere and traps more heat. This is called [[global warming]].

=== Weather, climate, and water cycle ===
Hot air rises. As it rises it gets colder again and falls. This is called [[convection]] currents.<ref name = NASA></ref> When hot air meets cold air different weather effects happen. Convection currents are the cause of almost all [[weather]] on Earth.  When it gets hot on the surface [[water]] [[evaporation|evaporates]] and becomes [[steam]] or water vapour. This hot water vapour rises. As it rises it gets colder. When it gets cold enough it turns back into water again. This causes the clouds and rain. It is called the [[water cycle]].<ref name= NASA />

== Orbit and rotation ==
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|right|200px|Earth's axial tilt (or obliquity) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]].]]
The Earth takes about 24 hours to complete one [[day]] and about 365 days to complete a [[year]]. Actually, the Earth takes 365.24 days to revolve around the Sun.<ref name=IERS></ref> To make up this quarter day every year, an extra day is added  every four years making the year 366 days. This is a [[leap year]]. The Earth is, on [[wikt:average|average]], 150 million kilometers away from the Sun, and moving at an average speed of almost 30 kilometers a second (66,616 miles an hour).<ref></ref>

[[The Moon]] orbits the Earth at an average distance of 250,000 miles. It is [[tide|tidally]] locked to Earth, which means it always has the same side facing the Earth. It takes roughly one [[month]] to complete one orbit.

The Earth is part of the [[Solar System]] and orbits the Sun along with thousands of small objects and seven other [[planet]]s. The Sun, and therefore the Solar System, are currently traveling through the Orion Arm of the [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]], and will be for approximately the next 10,000 years.<ref></ref>
